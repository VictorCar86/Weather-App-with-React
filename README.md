# â˜€ Weather App made with React

ðŸŒ¦ Search for the weather of a specific place, the city you live or any location you want to confirm whether it's going to rain or sunny.

### I've used two APIs for this project, both were OpenWeatherAPI and GeoDB Cities from Rapid API.

OpenWeatherAPI: https://openweathermap.org/api

Rapid API: https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/
